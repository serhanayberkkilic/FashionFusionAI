# FastfusionAI - Phase 1: Basic Clothing Upload and Recommendation (Web MVP)

**1. Overview**

This document details the development process for Phase 1 of the FastfusionAI project, focusing on the core functionality of basic clothing upload and recommendation for a **web application** MVP. The aim of this phase is to enable users to upload photos of their clothing through a web browser and receive elementary clothing recommendations, while gathering early user feedback.

**2. Objectives**

* Enable users to upload photos of their clothing items or outfits via a web interface.
* Provide basic clothing recommendations based on the uploaded photos.
* Create a user interface accessible through web browsers that allows users to easily access and utilize these core functionalities.
* Gather early user feedback to inform the roadmap for the next phase.
* Establish and validate the fundamental technological infrastructure for a web application.

**3. Features**

* **3.1. Clothing Photo Upload:**
    * Users should be able to upload photos of clothing from their computer or mobile device through the web browser.
    * Supported file formats: JPEG, PNG.
    * Maximum file size: To be determined (e.g., 10MB).
    * A simple loading indicator should be displayed during the upload process.

* **3.2. Basic Clothing Recommendation:**
    * Provide elementary recommendations based on the clothing item or outfit in the uploaded photo.
    * These recommendations will initially be based on the following simple rules:
        * **Color Matching:** Suggesting other clothing items in colors that complement the uploaded item. For example, if a blue shirt is uploaded, beige or white pants might be suggested.
        * **Basic Style Rules:** Recommendations based on simple style principles. For instance, if a sporty t-shirt is uploaded, jeans or shorts might be suggested.
        * **Seasonal Suggestions (Very Basic):** Suggesting other clothing items that might be suitable for the same season based on the general type of the uploaded item. For example, if a coat is uploaded, a scarf or gloves might be suggested.
    * Basic information for the recommended items (e.g., "White T-Shirt", "Blue Jeans") should be displayed as text.
    * **Visuals of the recommended items will not be included in this phase** (MVP focus).

* **3.3. Basic User Interface (Web):**
    * **Homepage:** Should include the application logo and a prominent button or area for uploading photos.
    * **Upload Area:** Clear visual cues for dragging and dropping files or selecting files from the computer. Progress bar indicating upload progress.
    * **Results Page:**
        * Image of the uploaded clothing item/outfit.
        * List of basic clothing recommendations (text descriptions).
    * The user interface should be simple, intuitive, and easy to navigate using a web browser. Complex animations or transitions will **not be included**. Responsive design for different screen sizes should be considered but kept basic.

* **3.4. Simple Results Display:**
    * The uploaded photo should be prominently displayed on the results page.
    * Clothing recommendations should be presented as a simple text list below the uploaded image.
    * Clicking on the recommended items will **not redirect to a details page** and there will be **no visual representation** (MVP focus).

* **3.5. Basic Data Collection and Analysis:**
    * Collect user interactions anonymously (e.g., number of photos uploaded, number of recommendations viewed).
    * The collected data will be used to understand which types of clothing are uploaded most often and which recommendations are viewed more frequently.
    * **No personal data will be collected.**

**4. Technologies**

* **Frontend (Web):**
    * **Framework/Library:** React, Vue.js, or plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript (choose based on team familiarity and project complexity).
    * **Reasoning:** Popular choices for building interactive web interfaces.

* **Backend:**
    * **Language/Framework:** Python (FastAPI).
    * **Reasoning:** Suitability for basic business logic and data management.

* **Database:**
    * **Option:** PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
    * **Reasoning:** Flexibility and easy data storage.

* **Recommendation Algorithm (Basic):**
    * Simple "if-else" logic-based rules or a basic rules engine.
    * Database of predefined style and color combinations.

**5. Success Criteria**

* The web application must function stably without crashing or experiencing significant errors.
* Users must be able to upload photos through the web interface.
* Basic clothing recommendations must be provided based on the uploaded photos.
* The user interface must be easy to use and understand through a web browser.
* The basic data collection mechanism must function and collect meaningful data.
* Early user feedback must be collectable (through surveys, forms embedded on the website, etc.).

**6. Development Process and Management**

* **Methodology:** Agile (Scrum) approach.
* **Sprint Length:** To be determined (e.g., 2-week sprints).
* **Tools:** Jira or Trello (project tracking), Git (version control).
* **Team:** A single developer or a small core team (developer, designer - if needed).

**7. Testing and Quality Assurance**

* **Unit Tests:** To verify that basic functions are working correctly.
* **Integration Tests:** To verify that different components are communicating correctly with each other.
* **User Testing:** Testing the basic functionality with a small group of users through web browsers to gather feedback. Cross-browser compatibility should be considered in testing.

**8. Risks and Challenges**

* The simplicity of the recommendation algorithm may result in suggestions that do not meet user expectations.
* The user interface may not meet user expectations or be intuitive enough for web users.
* Performance issues may arise (although it will not be visually intensive).
* Ensuring cross-browser compatibility.

**9. Next Steps**

* After the completion of Phase 1, collected user feedback and performance data will be analyzed.
* Based on this analysis, the roadmap for Phase 2 will be updated (potentially including image segmentation and more advanced recommendations).

**10. Appendices (If Necessary)**

* Wireframes (Basic screen designs for web pages).
* Database Schema (Basic data structures).
* List of Basic Recommendation Rules.

This document provides a framework for the first phase of the FastfusionAI project as a **web application**, focusing on basic clothing upload and recommendation, with features like image segmentation deferred to a later phase. This document may be updated and detailed further throughout the development process.
